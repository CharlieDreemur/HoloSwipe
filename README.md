Holoswipe is a 7 day long game where you must prove your allegiance to your Holomyth oshis by buying out all their merch. Youâ€™ll have a short period of time to explore the convention and buy merch, before Yagoo kicks you out and robs you blind. Each day, you must reach the necessary fanscore shown in the top left to survive till the next day. Spend as much as possible and avoid deadly (for your wallet) disasters. Have fun!
